# Short overview

This Terraform code defines infrastructure resources for a VPC and EC2 instance <br>
with a public subnet, an internet gateway, and a security group for the instance.<br>

The provider for the code is AWS, and it takes the region information from a variable defined in a variables.tf file.<br>

The code defines a VPC resource using the aws_vpc block and sets its CIDR block, instance tenancy, and tags. <br>
It also defines a public subnet using the aws_subnet block, which has a CIDR block, VPC ID, and an availability zone that is set to a variable.<br>

An internet gateway resource is created using the aws_internet_gateway block and is associated with the VPC. <br>
A public route table is defined with a route for all traffic using the internet gateway, using the aws_route_table block.<br>

A route table association resource is created using the aws_route_table_association block to associate the public subnet with the public route table.<br>

Finally, an EC2 instance resource is created with an AMI, instance type, subnet ID, and a user data script to install and start an HTTP server. <br>
A security group is defined for the instance with dynamic ingress rules for specified ports and a default egress rule allowing all traffic.<br>

Overall, this Terraform code provisions a VPC with a public subnet, an internet gateway, <br>
and an EC2 instance with a security group that allows incoming traffic on specified ports.
